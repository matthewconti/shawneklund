## Welcome
Welcome to the United States (U.S.) Department of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet Training and Testing (AFTT) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement (OEIS) website, an online resource for information concerning training and testing activities in sea space in and airspace over the Atlantic Ocean along the eastern coast of North America, portions of the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico (the AFTT Study Area).

The U.S. Navy invites you to participate in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for the AFTT EIS/OEIS.  This website provides information about the EIS process, including previously completed NEPA studies, project background, EIS project schedule, and opportunities for public involvement. Updates to this website will be made throughout the EIS process to keep you informed about the project.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
